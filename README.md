Azure: ARM Virtual Network Gateway Diagnostics (VPN)
====================================================

            

This script sample demonstrates how the Azure Virtual Networks PowerShell cmdlets can be utilized to gather Azure Gateway Diagnostics data. This logging is useful for troubleshooting VPN connection issues, and includes messages such as MainMode SA (Phase
 1) and QuickMode SA (Phase 2) negotiation. Output data is saved to your Azure storage account, and then is downloaded to a local text file for viewing.
